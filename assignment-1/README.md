# My answer:
Why I Chose the Profession of a Designer

In 2025 and even now, the demand for UI/UX designers is steadily growing. As more entrepreneurs and businesses shift their focus online, having a strong digital presence is no longer optional—it’s essential. One of the most effective ways to attract and retain users is by offering an engaging, intuitive, and user-friendly experience. This is where UI/UX design plays a critical role.

I was drawn to this field because it allows me to blend creativity with problem-solving. I enjoy thinking from the user’s perspective and designing solutions that are both beautiful and functional. UI/UX design is not just about aesthetics; it’s about understanding human behavior, simplifying technology, and making people’s interactions with digital products more enjoyable and efficient.

The UI/UX and web design sphere is so popular now because almost every industry—from healthcare to e-commerce—relies on digital platforms. People expect seamless, fast, and pleasant experiences online. Companies know that good design directly affects user satisfaction, customer retention, and ultimately, business growth.

I want to work in a dynamic and innovative environment, possibly in a tech company or a creative agency in South Korea. My goal is to be part of a team that values user-centered design and creates impactful digital experiences. I believe this profession gives me the opportunity to grow creatively and professionally, while also contributing to meaningful and accessible design for everyone.
